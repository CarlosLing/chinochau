This is a React + TypeScript Vite frontend for the chinochau project. The frontend should interact with the FastAPI backend for flashcard management (CRUD), fetching examples, and displaying Chinese learning tools. Use axios for API calls. All UI should be clean, responsive, and user-friendly for language learners.
